NEW:
	-Reduce number of filters in conv2d layers
	-Maybe remove last conv2d layer
	-Add transformations in ImageDataGenerator, see how well it performs

Definitely:
	-Add validation data
	-Early stopping
	-Remove TensorFlow from floyd_requirements.txt, see if performance improves (using their pre-compiled tensorflow)
Maybe:
	-Data augmentation (probably not necessary since class_weights are used)
	-Use different optimizer (Nesterov) + learning schedule
	-L1/L2, Max-norm or Batch normalization (probably not necessary since I have dropout)
	-Experiment with different initialization strategies (currently using Glorot Uniform)
